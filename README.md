# `rendy-pbr`

This is a toy realtime physically-based renderer written with `rendy`, a 'make-your-own-renderer' toolkit
which builds on `gfx-hal` by providing a render graph, compile- and run-time safety checks, and
other helpers.

## Planned features/next steps:

* [x] Physically based shading model
* [x] Point lights
* [x] Basic `glTF` import
* [x] HDR rendering with a tone mapping pass
* [x] More robust `glTF` import
* [x] Scene format for loading models from multiple glTF files
* [ ] Diffuse and specular environment mapping
* [ ] Directional lights
* [ ] Shadow mapping
